    <description><![CDATA[By installing the impersonate app of your Nextcloud you enable administrators to impersonate other users on the Nextcloud server. This is especially useful for debugging issues reported by users.

To impersonate an user an administrator has to simply follow the following three steps:

1. Login as administrator to Nextcloud
2. Open the user administration interface
3. Select the impersonate button on the affected user
4. Confirm the impersonation

The administrator is then logged-in as the user, to switch back to the regular user account they simply have to press the logout button.

**Note:**

- This app is not compatible with instances that have encryption enabled.
- While impersonate actions are logged note that actions performed impersonated will be logged as the impersonated user.
- Impersonating an user is only possible after their first login.]]></description>
